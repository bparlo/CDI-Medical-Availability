# CDI-Medical-Availability
This is an old class project written in RStudio. The work primarily involved fitting linear and multiple linear regression models.

# Note: I am not making the code public due to University restrictions 

# Detailed Description
As mentioned above, this project consisted of fitting linear and multiple linear regression models to healthcare data from 440 counties in the United States. The main variables that we investigated were the number of physicians, population of a county, the number of hospital beds, and the average income. We fitted several confidence intervals for the our beta values, conducted ANOVA tests, and investigated regression statistics. 

# Conclusions, in brief
We found that generally, larger populations, higher incomes, and higher average ages of the population, all led to more physicicans being employed in hospitals in any given county.
